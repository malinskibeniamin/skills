Use this template for writing the PR body:

```markdown
## Summary

<diagram, diff-sketch, or tree>

## Evidence

<frontend: before/after flow video playing inline (user-attachments URL), then screenshot table>

- **Before:** <screenshot/output/failing test run>
  **After:** <screenshot/output/passing test run>

## Merge Danger

**Door:** <one-way or two-way>

<optional: description>

**Blast Radius:** <one-word description>

<optional: potential ramifications of merge>
```

## Sections

Skip all preambles and keep prose brief. Use the user's domain language from `CONTEXT.md`.

### Summary

Pick the smallest view that makes the key point clear.

Choose from the views in [SUMMARY-VIEWS.md](SUMMARY-VIEWS.md): pseudocode, call trees, component trees, file trees, Mermaid, diffs, or the whole block.

#### Guidance

Place each visual next to the short text it supports. Keep only the calls, files, props, states, and boundaries needed to answer the user's current question or the options to resolve the current discussion point.

You may use one of these, you may use several, it is unlikely you will use all of them. Use your judgement and don't overwhelm the user.

### Evidence

Concrete evidence that the change works. Show a before and after.

For any frontend change, a before/after video of the real UI flow (clicks, typing, resulting state; never a still page) playing inline, plus screenshots, is S-tier and required. Put it right after the summary so reviewers see the change before reading about it. Capture, compose, and host it per [commit-push-pr visual evidence](../commit-push-pr/REFERENCE.md#frontendcustomer-facing-detection--screenshot-table-phase-5).

Execution-based evidence is A-tier. Test results, console output. Show the exact test that now fails and passes, using pseudocode.

### Merge Danger

Describe whether it's a one-way or two-way door. You can walk back through two-way doors, but not one-way doors. A PR that is cheap to roll back is lower risk. Changes that involve destructive actions or hard-to-reverse decisions are one-way doors.

The blast radius is the potential impact or scope of the changes introduced by this PR. Consider all possibilities. Examples are layout shift, breakages for consumers, mobile responsiveness, etc.
