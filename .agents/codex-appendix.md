## Codex-specific

### Commits

`type(scope): description` -- feat|fix|refactor|style|test|docs|chore|perf|ci|build|revert. Scope required. Lowercase, 5-72 chars. (Codex has no conventional-commits deny hook on every event; state the format here.)

### Runtime notes

- Hooks arrive per-call (no PostToolBatch); behavior is generated to parity from skill-manifest.json.
- `process.env` allowed only in build/test configs; app code goes through `@/env`.
- Subagent output enforcement is best effort; follow `agents/references/findings-schema.md` for review findings.
